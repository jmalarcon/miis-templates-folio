## A sea of life

Welcome to Paradise: **Vigo** is the perfect city for **active tourism**. Don't be fooled by its industrial feel, Vigo's **natural environment** is unique and incomparable. There's a belt of forest parks surrounding the city that makes it ideal for **hiking** and **biking routes**. You'll be amazed by the views of the [Vigo Estuary](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/2306), seen from the highest points of our mountains. You'll find fountains, rivers, streams, and even reservoirs for the **fishing** season. They all flow into our **beaches**, where you can **surf, windsurf or kite surf**; even in the centre, you can immerse yourself in nature by climbing the **[O Castro Mountai](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/1102)n** and jogging or practicing **athletics** in **Castrelos Park**.

The [**Cíes Islands**](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/1807), located in the [**Vigo Estuary**](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/2306)and part of the *Parque Nacional Illas Atlánticas* (**[Atlantic Islands National Park](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/2336)**), are a paradise of white sand **beaches** and clear waters. This is a stunning natural environment where you can enjoy **hiking, diving, anchoring your boat** or simply strolling by the sea.

The **Cíes Islands** are the **Vigo estuary's greatest treasure**: an amazing national marine-terrestrial park and one of the country's most beautiful places, which is why the Romans named them the *islands of the gods*.

The Cíes archipelago is made up of three islands: Monte Agudo, O Faro and San Martiño. The first two are connected by a long strip of sand: [Rodas Beach](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/2394), **the best beach in the world**, according to [*The Guardian*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2007/feb/16/beach.top10).

The Cíes are part of the **Atlantic Islands National Park**, a beach paradise with crystalline waters, in a natural environment that makes it a unique wildlife observatory.

A **visit to the Cíes** is ideal for hiking with your family or for a getaway in search of quiet and **unspoilt beaches**. You can take a day [boat trip to the Cíes](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/2348) or rent a yacht in Vigo. Or, if you prefer, spend a **weekend camping in the Cíes Islands**. It's also a great place for [diving in the Vigo estuary](http://www.turismodevigo.org/en/node/2333) and, with a bit of luck, you can swim surrounded by *arroaces* (native, smaller sized dolphins).
